## This project was designed for a specific client who was facing some challenges with the new hires' performance.
### Challenge: The mentors must review the new hires' solutions for their new assigned cases
### Solutions: developing a Power Apps app that can accomplish the goal and more.
### Ideas implemented: 
- The app allows new hires to choose their mentor to review their cases with teams notifications for both the mentor and the new hire using Power Automate.
- chat channel between the mentor and new hire on the app
- Mentors can assign cases to new hires
- Mentors and new hires can see their current cases and their status, and can follow up on their cases
-  Admin page to manage the app entries, users, and privacy 
- SharePoint List is a data source 
- Power BI dashboard for the reporting (included in the app)
- Office 365 connector is being used in this app
